                Without creativity we would be standing still, to inspire others to find and learn new things, is one
                of
                the hightlight of my life. I love seeing others reach their goals and make their dreams come true.
                I&apos;m happy that I have been able to help others, inspiring new
                generations in dancing, and in the future looking forward
                to help new developers</p>

            <h2 className="textSplit fadeInRight stop">My work as a dancer</h2>
            <p>
                I been working with artforms within the dance &quot;world&quot;, since 1990, performing, teaching, organizing, helping
                schools to
                find &quot;streetdance&quot; teachers, mentoring dancers,
                set schedules, worked with different projects, also with non-profit organizations and inspired the youth
                and kids to move their bodies. 
                I&apos;ve aslo been deeply involved and interested in the artforms and
                culture of HIP-HOP & FUNK, a deep passion for the dance style & artform of locking<br/>

            <h2 className="textSplit fadeInRight stop">Dance and code? Connection?</h2>
            <p>
                Working with creativity and artforms has helped me a lot in my life, and now when
                I&apos;m coding I see the similarities between the two. Co-work, team-work is a key to better &quot;performance&quot; and also communication is must to be able to work together. 
                If there is a problem, analyze it and find a solution. 
                <br/>
                In the artform of Hip-Hop, there is a saying - ALWAYS A STUDENT, in otherwords always be open to learn new,
                so this is what I saw in
                programming, and it might not be the same
                vocabulary, but the same thought. <br/>
                 <br/>
                Today both dancing and developing, learning new as I go and working with this for a few years, coding just becomes more fun
                for everyday that passes. :D
